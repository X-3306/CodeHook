# CodeHook
Advanced Function Hooking Utility: Seamlessly intercept and manipulate function execution flow. Redirect calls from target functions to custom hooks for dynamic behavior customization with powerful memory manipulation techniques.



the code is to modify the behavior of the original function by employing a hacking technique. Here is an explanation of the next steps:

Memory Allocation: At the beginning, the code allocates memory the size of two pages of memory. This is where the original function code will be copied and modifications will be made.

Code copying: Using the memcpy function, the code of the original function is copied into allocated memory. In this way, we create a copy of the original function, which we will modify.

Changing the memory page protection: Next, we change the memory page protection to write mode. This gives us the ability to modify the copied function code.

Code modification: In this step we modify the copied function code. Specifically, we replace the original function call statement with the hack function call statement. For this purpose, we replace the appropriate bytes in the copied code. The address of the hacking function is computed and used to generate the appropriate offset.

Restoring memory page protection: After making modifications to the code, we restore memory page protection to read-only mode. This prevents unauthorized changes to the copied code.

Hack function call: Now we can call the hack function which will now be executed instead of the original function. Executing this function allows us to introduce our own logic or changes to the behavior of the function.

Freeing memory: Finally, the code frees the allocated memory.
